# windows_wifi_hotspot
Batch files for creating wifi hotspot on your pc, without installing any other programs. (Req. to have Administrator account)

For windows 10, do the following lines. For other versions of Windows, figure it out yourself by reading the following lines.


1. Run the "wifi_set.bat" and the "wifi_start.bat" files, respectively.

2. Then, Go to "Network and Sharing Center", select your internet provider modem's "Connections" tab from the list.

3. Click on the "Properties" button, go to the "Share" tab and check "Let other network users use this PC's internet..." button, then select your newly created hotspot's connection type from the list. (You can find that connection type by going to 2, and looking at the newly created Hotspot's "Connections" button)

From now on, you will only deal with the "wifi_start.bat" and the "wifi_stop.bat" files, to start and stop Wifi Hotspot, respectively.

You can also use "wifi_status.bat" to check the status of the Wifi Hotspot.

I am sure you'll figure out how to use these .bat files. :)

Cheers!
